# 2 - Testing

## 2.1 Test code coverage of 90% minimum

#### Context & justification

Ensuring **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is widely practiced across Made Tech, tests should be written for _every_ piece of code. Test code coverage of 90% minimum **should** indicate that 10% of code is not covered by tests. In some cases, tests cannot be written for every piece of code so 90% is chosen as the minimum. However, all project teams should aim to write tests for 100% of their code.

* [ ] Test code coverage of 90% minimum

## 2.2 Unit tests that run in under 30 seconds

#### Context & justification

Each feature should be tested in isolation hence unit testing. Unit tests are necessary in order to ensure the code written  is correct. These tests should typically run in under 30 seconds unless there is good reasoning behind why this cannot be achieved.

* [ ] Unit tests that run in under 30 seconds

## 2.3 End-to-end tests that run in under 5 minutes

#### Context & justification

End-to-end (E2E) tests, as part of **Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)**, are also necessary in order to ensure the code written does what it is supposed to do. As the name suggests, end-to-end tests collobarate with the user, developer/engineer and tester. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate the compliance of the code with the business requirements. Hence, these tests should optimally run in under 5 minutes.
