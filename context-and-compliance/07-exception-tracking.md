# 7 - Exception tracking

## 7.5 - Reported exceptions resolved within a week

#### Context & justification

Exceptions that have been thrown but not caught or handled safely could lead to larger problems for applications and teams. It's good for teams to have the discipline of regularly checking, or acting upon reported exceptions as they occur during development to prevent these from accruing. If code changes have been made to handle these, the exceptions should be marked as resolved in the tracking service. No reported exceptions in the past week is a positive sign of well managed exceptions.

#### Compliance
