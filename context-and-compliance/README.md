# Context & compliance

Where the productionisation checklist serves as a overall health check for the applications we maintain, it doesn't have the scope for providing context and justifications for the specific checklist items existing in the first place. These documents try to provide that information as well as providing the ways to make your application compliant for those items.

The current set of recommendations are a consolidation of Made Tech learnings over the years, and a way of sharing knowledge amongst the company of how we can achieve these particular topics in a tried and tested manner.

We encourage teams to explore alternatives to these current suggestions, however, if a team deviates from these, then there is a need to have the same context and justifications given for why they haven't been used. This is so that the SRE team can consider whether to adopt these new alternatives into this set of suggestions, or decide if by deviating, that there is a risk to the reliability and maintainability of an application as a result.

As the SRE is the defacto on-call team for these applications, it is important for the team to feel confident in the application and it's current state so that it can be supported currently and in the future, otherwise the delivery team may need to be the 1st responders in an on-call period for that application.
