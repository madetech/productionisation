# How to contribute

To add something that you feel is missing on the list, add it to the list along with a writeup of the context and justification around the addition saved in the [context and compliance](https://github.com/madetech/productionisation/tree/context-and-compliance/context-and-compliance) folder, under the relevant heading.

While making additions please be mindful of the current numbering order and avoid renumbering points, as they might be referenced elsewhere.
